3,1,Yamaha OPL3-SA2 (Toshiba Satellite 465CDX laptop),OPL3-SAx chipsets have Sound Blaster Pro emulation
3,5,Reveal v1.10 / Gallant SC-6000,"Gallant SC-6000 cards are Sound Blaster Pro compatible clones with WSS and CD-ROM interfaces. Pro emulation accepts secret DSP commands to read/write IRQ/DMA and other resources and change the reported DSP version. It accepts a subset of Sound Blaster 16 DSP playback/recording commands for 8/16-bit PCM DMA."
2,2,Sound Blaster 2.0,"Creative CT1350B Sound Blaster"
4,16,Sound Blaster 16 ViBRA16XV,"Creative CT4170 Sound Blaster 16 ViBRA16XV (Plug & Play). PnP ID CTL00F0"
4,13,Sound Blaster 16 ViBRA16C,"Creative CT4180 Sound Blaster 16 ViBRA16C (Plug & Play). PnP ID CTL0070"
4,16,Sound Blaster AWE64,"Creative CT4500 Sound Blaster AWE64 (Plug & Play). PnP ID CTL00C3"
4,16,Sound Blaster AWE64 Gold,"Creative CT4540 Sound Blaster AWE64 Gold (Plug & Play). PnP ID CTL00B2"
2,1,Gravis Ultrasound / SBOS emulation,"Gravis Ultrasound SBOS.EXE TSR emulation using the non-maskable interrupt in real mode. Gravis Ultrasound DMA transfer rate cannot be moderated and therefore any code that uses the DMA playback pointer will see periods of rapid movement followed by no movement between IRQs. Mono single-cycle PCM playback only."
1,3,Gravis Ultrasound / MEGAEM emulation,"Gravis Ultrasound MEGAEM.EXE uses EMM386.EXE virtual 8086 mode to trap I/O to Sound Blaster for emulation. Not very stable. Supports command line option to report DSP 2.00 but does not change much about emulation. Will hang the machine with error message on purpose if any unknown command is given. Gravis Ultrasound DMA transfer rate cannot be moderated and therefore any code that uses the DMA playback pointer will see periods of rapid movement followed by no movement between IRQs. Mono single-cycle PCM playback only."
2,1,NTVDM Sound Blaster emulation (Windows XP and higher),"NTVDM.EXE has extremely miminal and absolutely terrible Sound Blaster 2.0 emulation built-in to the Windows NT DOS VM environment. You should install VDMSOUND.EXE if you want to run DOS games."
