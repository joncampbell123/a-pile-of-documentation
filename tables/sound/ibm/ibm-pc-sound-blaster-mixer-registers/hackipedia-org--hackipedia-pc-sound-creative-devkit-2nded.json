		"On Sound Blaster Pro, the undefined mixer bits are always (1) when read back, no matter what was written. This fact is used by some DOS programs and drivers to detect a Sound Blaster Pro and such code will fail to detect a Pro if those bits do not always read back (1). Sound Blaster 16 reclaims one reserved bit to extend the Pro compatible registers. It is not known if the CT1335 Sound Blaster 2.0 behaves the same way."
