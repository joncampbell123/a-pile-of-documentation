0xD0,,,DMA Stop,"The command might be better described as 'pause DMA'"
0xD1,,,Turn speaker on,"The actual effect is apparently to enable the amplifier on the card. When the speaker is off, the audio output might sound like a quiet crackle"
0xD3,,,Turn speaker off,
0xD4,,,DMA Continue,"A better title might be 'resume DMA'"

0x40,tc,,Set Time Constant,"Time constant determines the playback rate of audio.\nComputed as 256 - 1000000 / frequency. A side effect is that it is impossible to precisely represent standard frequencies like 11025Hz this way.\n\nThe lowest sample rate possible this way is 3906Hz (256 - 1000000/3096 = 0x00), the highest is 1MHz (256 - 1000000/1000000 = 256 - 1 = 0xFF) although for obvious reasons the DSP caps the sample rate at what it can support."
