0xD0,,,DMA Stop,"The command might be better described as 'pause DMA'"
0xD1,,,Turn speaker on,"The actual effect is apparently to enable the amplifier on the card. When the speaker is off, the audio output might sound like a quiet crackle"
0xD3,,,Turn speaker off,
0xD4,,,DMA Continue,"A better title might be 'resume DMA'"
