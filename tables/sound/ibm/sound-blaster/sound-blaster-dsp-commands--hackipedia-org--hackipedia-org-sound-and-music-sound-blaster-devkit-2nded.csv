0x10,nn,1.0+,,8-bit direct mode single byte digitized sound output,"Takes 8-bit unsigned byte nn and sends it to the DAC.\nAudio playback through this command is possible if the CPU is willing to spend time doing it instead of using DMA"
0x14,lo hi,1.0+,,8-bit single cycle DMA mode digitized sound output,"Begin 8-bit DMA playback, single cycle. lo, hi is (number of 8-bit samples - 1).\nNote that for Sound Blaster Pro stereo the number is the count of individual per channel 8-bit samples meaning the number of sample pairs times two."
0x16,lo hi,1.0+,,Creative 8-bit to 2-bit ADPCM single-cycle DMA mode digitized sound output,"lo, hi is (number of 8-bit samples - 1)"
0x17,lo hi,1.0+,,Creative 8-bit to 2-bit ADPCM single-cycle DMA mode digitized sound output with reference byte,"lo, hi is (number of 8-bit samples - 1)\nFirst byte from DMA is 8-bit unsigned PCM reference sample"
0x1C,,2.0+,,8-bit auto-init DMA mode digitized sound output,"Begin 8-bit DMA playback in auto-init mode, which does not require the interrupt handler to start a new block as one would normally do in single cycle mode required by Sound Blaster 1.x cards. The DSP block size used by this command is set by DSP command 48h"
0x1F,,2.0+,,Creative 8-bit to 2-bit ADPCM auto-init DMA mode digitized sound output with reference byte.lo, hi is (number of 8-bit samples - 1)\nFirst byte from DMA is 8-bit unsigned PCM reference sample. DSP block size is set by DSP command 48h"
