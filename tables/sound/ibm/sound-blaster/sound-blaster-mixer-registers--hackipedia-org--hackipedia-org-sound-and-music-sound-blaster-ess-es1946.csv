This mode splits hardware volume counters (61h and 63h) from the master volume control registers (60h and 62h). The host software is responsible for reading the counter register and updating the master volume registers. 0 = Disable Split mode. Hardware volume and master volume registers are slaved together. Registers 61h and 63h cannot be independently accessed.\nBit 6 MPU-401 IRQ mask: This bit is AND’d with the MPU-401 interrupt request. If this bit is low, the MPU-401 interrupt request stays low.

If this bit is low, the hardware volume interrupt request does not get OR’d with the audio 1 interrupt request. This bit is cleared by hardware reset. When high, enables the hardware volume control to be shared with the audio interrupt.\nBit 0 SB Pro master volume disable: When low, a write to legacy master volume registers 22h or 32h is translated into a write to the hardware master volume counters, Mixer registers 60h and 62h.
