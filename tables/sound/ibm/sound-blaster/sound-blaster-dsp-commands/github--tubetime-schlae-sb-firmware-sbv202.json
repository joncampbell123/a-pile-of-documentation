		"DSP commands derived are based on careful study of the source code and aliases of DSP commands that result from the way they are processed.",
		"Notes for those studying the code who may be overly assustomed to x86 assembly language: jb/jnb in 8051 assembly language is a branch on whether or not a bit is set/not set. It is not a JB (branch if below) like 8088 asm.",
		"Entries list only those commands that are either alises of existing commands or undocumented commands",
		"The quirks noted may exist in other pre-SB16 revisions of Sound Blaster hardware. Testing is needed to update the DSP verions listed in this table.",
		"Sound Blaster 2.0 DSP cold boot state (full reset):\nDAC output = 0x80\nTime constant = 0x9C\nDSP DMA ID = 0xAA 0x96\nDMA block size = 0x7FF (0x800 samples)\nStatus register = 0x00",
		"'cold boot' and 'warm boot' is set by a magic value in DSP memory. 'cold boot' is a full reset of the DSP, 'warm boot' is often used to allow DSP reset to break out of certain commands without resetting DSP state such as the 'High speed DMA playback' commands."
