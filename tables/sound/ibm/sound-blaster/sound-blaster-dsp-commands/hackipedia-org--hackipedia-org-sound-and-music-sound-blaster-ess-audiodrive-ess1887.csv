0xA2,nn,,"ESS AudioDrive","Filter Clock Divider (Extended register)","This register controls the low-pass frequency of the switch-capacitor filters inside the ES1878. Generally, the filter roll-off should be positioned at 80% - 90% of the Sample_Rate/2 frequency. The ratio of the roll-off frequency to the filter clock frequency is 1:82. In other words, first determine the desired roll-off frequency by taking 80% of the Sample_Rate divided by 2, then multiply by 82 to find the desired Filter Clock frequency. Use the formula below to determine the closest divider:\n\nFilter_Clock_Frequency = 7.16 MHz / (256-Filter_Divider_Register)"
0xA4,nn,,"ESS AudioDrive","Transfer Count Reload register – low byte (Extended register)","On reset, this register assumes the value of 00h. Low byte of 16-bit value in port A5h,A4h. See port A5h"
0xA5,nn,,"ESS AudioDrive","Transfer Count Reload register – high byte (Extended register)","On reset, this register assumes the value of F8h. The FIFO control logic of the ES1878 has a 16-bit counter for controlling transfers to and from the FIFO. These registers are the reload value for that counter which is the value that gets copied into the counter after each overflow (plus at the beginning of the initial DMA transfer). The counter will be incremented after each successful byte is transferred via DMA. Since the counter counts up towards FFFFh and then overflows, the reload value is in 2’s complement form.\n\nFor Auto-Initialize DMA, the counter is used to generate interrupt requests to the system processor: in this mode DMA continues indefinitely as far as the ES1878 is concerned. In a typical application the counter is programmed to be one-half of the DMA buffer maintained by the system processor. In this case an interrupt is generated whenever DMA switches from one half of the circular buffer to the other.\n\nFor Normal Mode DMA, DMA requests will be halted at the time that the counter overflows, until a new DMA transfer is commanded by the system processor. Again, an interrupt request will be generated to the system processor if bit 6 of register B1 is set high."
