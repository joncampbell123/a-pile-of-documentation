		"Sound Blaster Pro registers 0x04, 0x0A, 0x0C, 0x22, 0x26, 0x28, and 0x2E are emulated by mapping to extended registers 0x14, 0x1A, 0x1C, 0x32, 0x36, 0x38, and 0x3E. On read, bits that did not exist on the original Sound Blaster Pro are cleared, and on write are zeroed, to mimic SB Pro behavior. 0x04, 0x22, 0x26, 0x28, and 0x2E are ORed by 0x11 on read and ANDed by 0xEE on write. Mic mix volume is ORed by 1 on read and ANDed by 0xFE on write. It is known from testing DOSBox/DOSBox-X that some DOS games use the stuck bits to detect Sound Blaster Pro hardware so doing this is a compatibility move. The full 8 bits of the mixer register are accessible at (index | 0x10)"
