0x00,W,"","","Reset Mixer","Write any 8-bit value to this register to reset the mixer chip. After a reset, all the registers will be restored to their default values."
0x04,R/W,"","","Voice volume","(OPL3-SAx)\nBits 7-5: Voice volume L\nBits 3-1: Voice volume R\n\nThe actual value written is translated according to a table with the Master volume to update the actual chipset volume. Reading the register will only return what was written, not the actual state of the hardware mixer"
0x0A,R/W,"","","Mic volume","(OPL3-SAx)\nBits 2-1: Mic volume\n\nMic volume can be read and written but has no effect"
0x0C,R/W,"","","(OPL3-SAx)\nInput Source / Low-Pass Filter / Input Filter","Bit 5: Input Filter\nBit 3: Low-Pass Filter\nBits 2-1: Input Source\n\nThe contents of this register can be read and written but have no effect"
0x0E,R/W,"","","Output Filter / Stereo Switch","Bit 5: Output Filter\nOutput filter off switch.\n0 ⇒ Output filter on, output through low-pass filter.\n1 ⇒ Output filter off, bypass the low-pass filter\nDefault is 0 ⇒ Output filter on.\n\nBit 1: Stereo Switch\nDigitized sound data stereo output switch.\nThis must be switched back to default as soon as stereo output is done.\n0 ⇒ mono output.\n1 ⇒ stereo output.\nDefault is 0 ⇒ mono output.\n\nTurn off the filter for high sampling rates or stereo output."
0x22,R/W,"","","Master volume","(OPL3-SAx)\nBits 7-5: Master volume L\nBits 3-1: Master volume R\n\nThe actual value written is translated according to a table with the Master volume to update the actual chipset volume. Reading the register will only return what was written, not the actual state of the hardware mixer"
0x26,R/W,"","","MIDI volume","(OPL3-SAx)\nBits 7-5: MIDI volume L\nBits 3-1: MIDI volume R\n\nThe actual value written is translated according to a table with the Master volume to update the actual chipset volume. Reading the register will only return what was written, not the actual state of the hardware mixer"
0x28,R/W,"","","CD volume","(OPL3-SAx)\nBits 7-5: CD volume L\nBits 3-1: CD volume R\n\nThe actual value written is translated according to a table with the Master volume to update the actual chipset volume. Reading the register will only return what was written, not the actual state of the hardware mixer"
0x2E,R/W,"","","Line volume","(OPL3-SAx)\nBits 7-5: Line volume L\nBits 3-1: Line volume R\n\nThe actual value written is translated according to a table with the Master volume to update the actual chipset volume. Reading the register will only return what was written, not the actual state of the hardware mixer"
