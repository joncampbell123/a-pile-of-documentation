		"The first version of the codepage 1252 used in Microsoft Windows 1.0 did not have positions D7 and F7 defined. All the characters in the ranges 80â€“9F were undefined too.",
		"The second version, used in Microsoft Windows 2.0, positions D7, F7, 91, and 92 had been defined.",
		"The third version, used since Microsoft Windows 3.1, had all the present-day positions defined, except euro sign and Z with caron character pair.",
		"The final version debuted in Microsoft Windows 98 and was ported to older versions of Windows with the euro symbol update."
