0x20-0x3F,,          Read byte from 8042 RAM. Byte index is low 5 bits of command,Byte 0 (command 0x20) is also known as the Command Byte
0x60-0x7F,nn,        Write byte nn to 8042 RAM. Byte index is low 5 bits of command,Byte 0 (command 0x60) is also known as the Command Byte
0x90-0x9F,,          Write bottom 4 bits of command to bottom 4 bits of the Output port,Bit 0 must be set or you may cause a hung condition where the CPU is stuck in a reset state
0xA7,,               Disable PS/2 mouse port
0xA8,,               Enable PS/2 mouse port
0xA9,,               Self-test mouse interface and return result byte
0xAA,,               Self-test 8042. Return 55h if success or FCh if failure
0xAB,,               Self-test keyboard interface and return result byte
0xAD,,               Disable keyboard,Sets bit 4 of Command Byte to inhibit keyboard
0xAE,,               Enable keyboard,Clears bit 4 of Command Byte
0xC0,,               Read Input Port
0xD0,,               Read Output Port
0xD1,     nn,        Write nn to Outport Port
0xD4,     nn,        Send command to PS/2 mouse
0xDD,,               Disable A20 line,Vectra PC
0xDF,,               Enable A20 line,Vectra PC
0xF0-0xFF,,          Pulse bits of Output Port low for 6 microseconds. Each zero bit in the command corresponds to the pin on the Output Port. Bit 0 is tied to the reset line on the CPU and command FEh is used to reset the CPU.
