	"notes": "ANSI control strings are portrayed where possible as escape code separated from parameters. ANSI escapes are usually ESC [ <paramaters> <code>. <parameters> can be nothing, one number, or multiple numbers separated by semicolons. The ANSI escape for bright yellow text for example would be written ESC [ 1;33m meaning 'm' to set attributes, 1 for bright, 33 for yellow. MS-DOS generally confirms to the ANSI standard in this way. If specific parameters set the function such as ESC [ 6n then the parameter is considered part of the escape but also listed as a param as well.",
