</UL> <HR><BR> The Arabic Tutor(TM) is the first Multimedia <B>Arabic
teaching software for 
beginners</B>
that works with the Microsoft Windows operating system. It features a 
<B> User-friendly</B> point and click feature with <B> sound </B>. The
first release came in December, 1994. Now, it is in version 2.1x for MS
Windows 3.1x, MS Windows 95 and NT. <P> This 
multimedia program assumes no prior knowledge of arabic. You can listen to
pronunciation, record your voice and compare it to native and watch
animated
illustration of how letters are written. Learn how to join letters into
words
and how to read words and sentences. Even basic grammar is included as
well 
as a selection of reading comprehension.<P>
To run The Arabic Tutor (TM), you need a PC running Windows 3.1 or later, 
a windows-compatible sound card, a 4 MB 
RAM (minimum) and 15 MB on the hard disk to run the program. The 32-bit
version (Windows 95 or NT 3.51 or later) requires enough RAM to run the
operating system. Version 2.1 is available only on a CD-ROM and requires
a 2X CD drive (4x recommended). <HR><A NAME="flash">
